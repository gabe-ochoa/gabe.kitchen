# Edie's Brisket

A Jewish Texan brisket to feed your soul.

### Serving Size

6 people / servings

### Ingredients:

- 1 (3½- to 4-pound) beef brisket
- 2 medium onions, sliced
- 1/2 lb potatoes
- 1/2 lb carrots
- 2 (12-ounce) cans beer
- ¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- ⅓ cup Worcestershire sauce
- 1 cup barbecue sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried whole thyme
- 1 teaspoon celery salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder

### Directions

- Trim off excess fat off the Brisket
- In skillet or dutch oven, braise brisket both sides with olive oil, salt/pepper and garlic. Not too much olive oil, just enough to coat pan, you want the Brisket to brown. Once browned, if using a skillet, move to baking pan that can hold liquid in the oven.
- Add all the ingredients in to the pan and fully cover the Brisket. Add potatoes, baby or cut carrots and if you want,sliced celery
- Cover with lid or foil and bake at 300 for 4-5 hours or until falling apart when using a fork.
  - Or, 3-4 hours until a fork can easily slide through it but it's still firm if you want sliced brisket.
